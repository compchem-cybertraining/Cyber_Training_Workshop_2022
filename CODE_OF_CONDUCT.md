## Workshop Objectives

* Get **familiar with a variety of software packages** relevant to modeling of excited states and nonadiabatic dynamics
* Get an overview of **theoretical background** for corresponding computational methods
* Get a **practical experience** with these tools and packages


## Project rules

* Consist of: a) short written report, b) presentation at the last day of workshop; c) set of input/output files deposited on the GitHub repository
* Should actively involve one of the packages discussed over the workshop period 
* Preferably not something you have an extensive experience with 
* Doesn't have to be a full-scale research project, but can be a step towards this direction
* Projects completed using local or home institution resources are eligible
* Can be an application or a coding project
* The consistency in your course work during this school will contribute to your chances to win the awards
* The awards decisions will be made based on the committee evaluation. The awards will be: 1 first prize ($300), 3 second

Notes:
>
> bolded are participants with access to UB HPC; GRA-N - graduate students, N-th year; PD - postdoc; FAC-PHD - faculty at a PhD-granting institution, 
> FAC-PUI - faculty at a primarily undergraduate institution
>
> `1st, 2nd (2 positions), and 3rd (5 positions) prizes` are won based on students' project presentations and course work documentation
>
> `graduated` means that student has documented their work via creating their GitHub repository with the corresponding materials
> these students might or might not have participated in the presentation section
> 
> `attended` means that students have participated in the workshop in some way - either by watching presentations or by following 
> the course work (hans-on) either on UB system or at their home institutions during the period of the workshop.
