Notes:
>
> bolded are participants with access to UB HPC; GRA-N - graduate students, N-th year; PD - postdoc; FAC-PHD - faculty at a PhD-granting institution
>
> `1st, 2nd (2 positions), and 3rd (5 positions) prizes` are won based on students' project presentations and course work documentation
>
> `graduated` means that student has documented their work via creating their GitHub repository with the corresponding materials
> these students might or might not have participated in the presentation section (see episode 13)
> 
> `attended` means that students have participated in the workshop in some way - either by watching presentations or by following 
> the course work (hans-on) either on UB system or at their home institutions during the period of the workshop.
